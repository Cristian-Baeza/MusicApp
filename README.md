Feel free to share, improve or add your own music. All you have to do is add to the object in data.js. Here is the site I used to pull the free music from: https://chillhop.com/
At least I think its free...now i'm not sure. Look man, if you dont say anything neither will I. Just enjoy the app and mind your own business.
