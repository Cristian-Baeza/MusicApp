# About

Greetings fellow human! Welcome to my Music App. Some goals I had when building this project: 
- Keep a clean/minimalist ui
- Practice using hooks. You will notice I did not use any class components. 
- Practice managing state. I found it extremely interesting how state was managed with hooks instead of class components. This project helped me to further understand how implementing Redux would help. 
- Make a project worthy of a portfolio
- Mobile Responsive (was going to add Bootstrap but I ended up only using about 5 lines of vanilla css code)

Overall this was a great learning experience. I only pulled out a third of my hair and, if you will allow me to brag, I only cried in the fetal position twice! Which is way less than when I first started learning Redux/thunk.
