Greetings fellow human! Welcome to my React Music App. <br/>
About: <br/>
-HTML
-CSS/Styled Components
-React (Hooks)
-React Router
-Framer Motion for animations
-Mobile Responsive


Overall this was a great learning experience. I only pulled out a third of my hair and, if you will allow me to brag, I only cried in the fetal position twice! Which is way less than when I first started learning Redux/thunk. 

Feel free to share, improve or add your own music! All you have to do is add to the object in data.js. Here is the site I used to pull the free music from: https://chillhop.com/
At least I think its free...now i'm not sure. Look man, if you dont say anything neither will I. Just enjoy the app and mind your own business.
