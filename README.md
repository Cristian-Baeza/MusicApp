Greetings fellow human! Welcome to my React Music App. Some goals I had when building this project: 

- Keep a clean/minimalist ui
- Use hooks. You will notice I did not use any class components. 
- Make a project worthy of a portfolio
- Mobile Responsive (was going to add Bootstrap but I ended up only using about 5 lines of vanilla css code)

Overall this was a great learning experience. I only pulled out a third of my hair and, if you will allow me to brag, I only cried in the fetal position twice! Which is way less than when I first started learning Redux/thunk. 

Feel free to share, improve or add your own music! All you have to do is add to the object in data.js. Here is the site I used to pull the free music from: https://chillhop.com/
At least I think its free...now i'm not sure. Look man, if you dont say anything neither will I. Just enjoy the app and mind your own business.
